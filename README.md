# Monte Carlo Simulation
Description: Conducted a detailed simulation study of two electronic filter circuits to understand how variations in component values affect their performance. This project was part of a hands-on experience in applying theoretical concepts to practical scenarios using simulation software.

## Responsibilities:
Used simulation tools to model and analyze the frequency response of electronic filters.
Performed statistical simulations (Monte Carlo analysis) to predict the performance range of the filters under different component conditions.
Visualized data to identify the stability and efficiency of the circuit designs.

## Skills Demonstrated:
Proficiency in using simulation software for circuit analysis.
Ability to apply statistical techniques to predict and interpret real-world circuit behavior.
Developed skills in data visualization and analysis to support engineering decisions.
